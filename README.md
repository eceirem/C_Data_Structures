# Data Structures With C

Welcome to my C Programming Repository! 
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing C programming. 
It includes various topics covered in my university curriculum and additional materials for self-study also comment lines for best explenation.

A key file in this repository is `modules.c`, which contains the fundamental components for creating, adding, finding, and deleting data structures. 
This file provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing various data structures in C.
